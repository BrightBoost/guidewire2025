### **1. Variables and Printing**
1. Create a variable `age` and assign your age to it. Print: "I am X years old."
2. Create a `name` variable and assign your name to it. Print: "Hello, my name is X."
3. Create a `year` variable for the current year. Print: "The year is X."
4. Combine `name` and `age` into a sentence: "Hi, Iâ€™m X and I am Y years old."
5. Create a `price` variable for an item you bought. Print: "This item costs $X."
6. Create a `firstName` and `lastName`. Print them together in the format: "Full name: X Y."
7. Assign your hometown to `city` and print: "I live in X."
8. Declare a boolean variable `isStudent`. If `isStudent` is true, print: "I am a student." If false, print: "I am not a student."
9. Combine a number and string in a variable: `int apples = 5; String sentence = "I have " + apples + " apples.";`. Print it.
10. Create a `char` variable for your favorite initial and print it: "My favorite letter is X."

### **2. Basic Math Operations**
1. Add two numbers: `a = 5, b = 10`. Print the sum.
2. Subtract two numbers: `x = 50, y = 25`. Print the result.
3. Multiply two numbers: `length = 4, width = 6`. Print the area.
4. Divide `total = 100` by `parts = 4`. Print the result.
5. Find the remainder of `a = 23` divided by `b = 7`. Print the remainder.
6. Add 10 to a `balance` variable. Print the new balance.
7. Calculate the average of `a = 12, b = 15, c = 18`. Print the result.
8. Create a `distance` variable in kilometers and convert it to meters. Print both.
9. Write a program to calculate the cost of 3 apples if each costs $2. Print the result.
10. Use variables to calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle (`a = 3, b = 4`). Print the result.

### **3. Boolean Operators**
1. Compare two numbers `a = 5, b = 10`. Print `a > b`.
2. Check if `x = 20` is not equal to `y = 15`. Print the result.
3. Combine conditions: `age > 18 && age < 60`. Print true or false.
4. Write a program that checks if a `number` is positive (`number > 0`).
5. Check if `x = 7` is divisible by `2` (`x % 2 == 0`). Print the result.
6. Combine conditions: Check if a number is even and greater than 10.
7. Write a program to compare two strings using `==` and `.equals()`. Print the result of both.
8. Use `||` to check if `score > 90` or `score < 50`. Print the result.
9. Write a program that evaluates `x = 5, y = 10`. Print true if `x * 2 == y`.
10. Bonus: Use an `if` statement to check if `temperature > 30`. Print "It's hot" or "It's cool."

### **4. String Methods**
1. Create a string `name = "John"`. Convert it to uppercase and print it.
2. Create a string `greeting = "HELLO"`. Convert it to lowercase and print it.
3. Compare two strings `str1 = "apple"` and `str2 = "APPLE"` using `.equals()`. Print the result.
4. Use `.substring()` to extract "Java" from `text = "Learn Java Programming"`.
5. Concatenate `firstName = "Mary"` and `lastName = "Ann"`. Print the full name.
6. Use `.length()` to print the number of characters in `sentence = "Hello, world!"`.
7. Replace all `e` with `a` in `str = "elephant"`. Print the result.
8. Check if `sentence = "Java is fun"` contains the word "fun" using `.contains()`.
9. THIS ONE IS ANNOYING: Combine `.toUpperCase()` and `.substring()` to extract and capitalize the first word in `text = "coding is great"`.
10. Reverse a string manually: `String input = "abc";` Print `cba` (hint: use `.charAt()` BONUS: in a loop).
